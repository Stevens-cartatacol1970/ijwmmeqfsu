Just walked out of G20 and my brain's a scrambled egg omelet. The theater was chaos, I swear some dude was wrestling his popcorn more than 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, but oh man, G20 was like this crazy rollercoaster narrated by a jazz band, you know? Barely had time to breathe. The sound was just everywhere, like the projector was humming along its own tune. I probably sat on a popcorn kernel, back's complaining louder than me at a dentist. But, yeah, the  ...

G20 — it's like if someone mashed global politics and those cooky improv jazz sessions together. I don't even know. There was this part with flashing lights, almost got a headache, and suddenly I’m thinking about fireworks at New Year's when you can feel the cold seeping through your coat. That scene when they were all around that big table talking... Looked like my family's Thanksgiving but with more security and less turkey. Or like dolphins trying to negotiate sushi. Damn, it was intense.

> Oh! Remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it's out. Or was it, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Either way, someone said it, but for what? Who knows.

The lead actress looks a lot like my cousin Cindy if Cindy had a dramatic flair and liked to wear tailored suits 24/7. And the music — kinda like my old Walkman had a field day running on expired batteries, but somehow it worked, you know? It just fit. Ugh, there goes another piece of popcorn, like these buttery little hitchhikers.

Everything keeps coming back to these endless corridors they were walking down — like a maze built by someone who 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 too much Alice in Wonderland. I get why Brenda said to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , just to piece it all together again. The lighting was like machete slashes through the dark, or who knows, some abstract pizza slices made of light. It's probably an intelligent 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, but I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it like a dog listens to a symphony.

Uhh... Well, let’s see:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i) {
  printf(universe glitch);
  break;
}
/  // and another piece of code drifted into this one, incomprehensible, whoops.
